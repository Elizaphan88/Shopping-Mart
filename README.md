#In order to add the structure for our Microsoft clone, we must include a few critical links inside our html files. Because CSS and JavaScript were used independently in this case, we must link to them in our HTML; their link must be inserted within the head tag. In addition, because we used symbols in our project, we must include the font-awesome URL for those as well.

#A clone website is split into three sections: the header, which contains the navbar and an image, the body, which contains the main content, and the footer, which contains any extra content.
