#In order to add the structure for our Microsoft clone, we must include a few critical links inside our html files. Because CSS and JavaScript were used independently in this case, we must link to them in our HTML; their link must be inserted within the head tag. In addition, because we used symbols in our project, we must include the font-awesome URL for those as well.

#A clone website is split into three sections: the header, which contains the navbar and an image, the body, which contains the main content, and the footer, which contains any extra content.

#We’ll put the icons with the div tag. We will add the bar icons inside the header section, and then build the navbar with the nav tag. We’ll make a navbar with the nav> element and the navbar links with the order list within it.

#Now we’ll create a home area and insert the home image using the p> and h3> tags. We will include the picture and paragraph within our
Similarly, we will add many other sections inside our Microsoft clone app, but before creating a clone website, you must be conscious of what content you want to include inside your clone app, and then add the necessary elements inside using the default tag.

#There is all the HTML code for the Microsoft website clone. You can now view results without using CSS or JavaScript. Then, for our Microsoft clone website, we create CSS and Javascript.

#We’ll now use the typeface family property to style the body. We will assign the font family to “Segoe UI” and the background property to “white.” We will change the font size to “15 px” and add a line height of 1.5 using the font size and line height properties.

#Step2:

We will add styling to the navbar using the class selector; we will set the display to “flex”; we will position the items to the center using the align item property; and we will set the height to “60px” using the height property. Similarly, we will apply the styling to all other elements in our navbar.
